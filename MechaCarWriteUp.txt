Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

The multiple linear regression model produced an r-squared value of 0.7149. We can assume from this result that roughly 29% of mpg predictions from this model will be correct. Vehicle weight, with a p score of .08, is the only variable to provide nonrandom variance to mpg.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the regression cannot be zero because there is a significant relationship between vehicle weight and miles per gallon. We can reject our null hypothesis.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The model demonstrates statistically significant relationship between vehicle weight and miles per gallon. We can infer from the r-squared value that vehicle weight is not the only factor required to predict MPG. We would need to look at other variables to create a more robust predictive model.
